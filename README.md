# Sub_Dominant-VST

A face-ripping, glitching fuzz inspired by the EQD Bit Commander guitar pedal.

The input signal is from the gain knob is heavily amplified and clipped, one output feeding into the 
base-octave "NORM" volume knob and another output feeding into two binary counters. These counters produce a
glitchy square wave one octave down from the base-octave and another glitchy square wave two octaves down.

The glitchiness of the sub-octaves can be controlled by the filter, "SUB OCT GLITCH", leading into the binary
counters. The filter cutoff frequency and the complexity of the input signal determines just how glitchy these
waves are.

Finally, the input signal is also fed into a full-wave rectifier to create a standard octave-up fuzz, the
volume of which is controlled by the "DOM" knob. The input signal can be blended back in to the fuzz signal
with the "BLEND" clean-blend knob.
